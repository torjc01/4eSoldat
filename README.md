[[[ 

Son of Major Alexander 'Alex' Young (52nd Battalion) and Annie Buxton Young (née Gardiner); husband of Nursing Sister Lieutenant Irene May Young (née Fellows).

Before the Great War, he was a cadet and then a member of the Militia in Québec, serving within the ranks of the 8th Regiment.

At First World War, he served the Canadian Machine Gun Corps, firstly with a rank of Sergeant, then commissioned to Lieutenant, teaching Machine Gun usage and bayonet combat to the troops in England, before being dispatched to the French front.

After the Great War, he joined the Royal Rifles of Canada (RRC) and rose through the ranks to become Lieutenant-Colonel and commanding officer of the regiment in 1934.

At Second World War, by the end of 1941, he is sent with the Royal Rifles to improve the defense of the colony of Hong Kong. This was a request from the British War Cabinet that Canada complied. On Dec 8th 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor attack, the Japanese attacked the colony. The defenders, British, Indian, Hong Kong volunteers and Canadians, put up a defense and were able to resist up to the 24th. On Christmas day, seeing that further resistance would be futile, the governor ordered all troops to surrender and avoid further life loss.

Brother Charles was captured after the end of the battle, on Dec 28th. He was the last to surrender command. He and his last troops were then captured. He was sent to the prisoner camp system, inside which he would spend the rest of the war, up to September 1945.

### The demand for troops 

*The British Government formally requested that Canada provides two infantry battalions for Hong Kong on 19 September 1941. Lawson's Directorate of Military training and Staff Duties had evaluated the battalions under consideration - the Royal Rifles of Canada (RRC) and the Winnipeg Grenadiers - as "not suitable" for deployment due to their long service in garrison duties in the West Indies and in Newfoundland and their requirement for further training. But the battalion's experience in garrison duties arguably made them well suited for what was expected to be much the same in Hong Kong. Hostilities with Japan were not yet considered imminent."* (Wentzell 2021, p. 3-4)

**Lt-Col C.A. Young Known as a Soldier and Sportsman** 

Lt-Col C.A. Young of Quebec, who died recently at Toronto, spent the Second World War with the Royal Rifles of Canada and commanded the last group of soldiers to surrender on the island. 

A veteran of both world wars, he was awarded the Military Cross for bravery in the Second (sic) World War. 

Well known in his youth as a sportsman, he became quite famous as a hockey player here. Among other sporting activities, he also excelled at curling. 

He was also a president of the Army, Navy and Airforce Association for many years. 

The 68-year-old army officer, who leaves many friends behind, was greatly admired by the men serving under his command. 

At the time of his sudden death, he was visiting his daughter, Mrs Harry Thompson, in Toronto. 

His father, the late Maj Alexander Young, was also a soldier and commanded the 52nd Battalion in the First World War. 

**Gravestone** 

His final resting place is in Québec City Cemetery Mount Hermon, in a quiet part of the city, in the most peaceful place inside the cemetery, near its centre, where the silence and peace reign absolute for his eternal rest.

# Family

## Arbre généalogique

Arbre généalogique approximative de la famille du Fr Charles Alexander Young. J'ai identifié à date trois générations de la famille qui ont appartenues à la franc-maçonnerie (quatre personnes ayant appartenu à Albion), et quatre générations qui ont appartenues aux Forces Canadiennes, dans le service militaire actif dans des zones de conflit (Northwest Rebellion, Boer War, Great War, WWII et guerre de la Corée). 

Brother Alexander Young was a Major at the time he fell in the [Battle of Sactuary Wood](https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/hill-62) (Hill 62) near Ypres; before, he had fought the Campaign in South Africa. 

Brother Alfred Grincell Fellows was a most beloved Sergeant-Major of 8th Regt RCGA in Québec City, who passed away before the war. He was lamented by a large crowd in his inhumation.

Brother William Grincell Fellows served in the Northwest Rebellion, and afterwards served as a Sergeant-Major in the Royal Canadian Regiment. He helped create the Railway Construction Regiment just before the Great War. He was a Major at the time, and could not be deployed with the Regiment because of health issues, what eventually led to his retirement from the Force. 

His sister, Florence May Young was a Nursing Sister in the war, decorated with the Associate Royal Red Cross, Second Class. And his wife, who he met in Europe during the war, was also a Nursing Sister!

# TODO

ALBION 

- Possibilité d'en discuter avec le T V Fr Arthur Ward - il était le VM de la loge lors du décès du Fr Young
- Vérifier dans les archives les dates d'Initiation, passage et élévation du Fr Charles Young 
- Checker s'il y a des faits saillants sur Fr Young dans les procès-verbaux de la secrétaire
- Vérifier si l'on a une statistique de la proportion de frères qui sont militaires dans l'active, ou qui sont passés par les forces. 
- Vérifier les données du TVF William Grincell Fellows (oncle de l'épouse) - vénérable Maître d'Albion l'année 1908
- Vérifier les données du Fr Alfred Grincell Fellows (Père de l'épouse)
- Vérifier auprès des archives si les frères Alfred Fellows, bien comme le frère Charles, étaient des membres effectifs d'Albion ou d'autre loge
- Demander le logo de la loge à Éric ou à Richard 

OTHER TASKS

- [OK] Vérifier si le Fr Harry Ralph Thompson (beau-fils - mari à Phylis) était membre de la loge - **Non, il était membre de la Riverdale Lodge #494, à l'Orient de Toronto.** 
- Acheter un shooter extra pour faire cadeau à Jayne 
- Check with Jayne des infos sur le service militaire de son père 
- [OK] Écrire un résumé du drama des Fellows 
- Faire recherche au registre foncier de la municipalité de Lac-St-Joseph pour retrouver le challet familial.

The courses on genealogical research offered by the Société de Généalogie du Québec allowed me to pursue the research of a richer set of documents that added to the density of sorces I had available to draw a picture of Brother Charles Alexander's life.

Brother Charles' granddaughter, whose help with personal and family insight were invaluable to the consecution of the project. 

She's also provided great photos that allowed a peek into the private life of Brother Charles Alexander. 

# Annexes
## Annex A - **Decorations**   

**Military Cross, MC**  
La Croix militaire peut être décernée aux officiers de grades ne dépassant pas le grade effectif de capitaine (autrement dit, les majors à titre temporaire et par intérim y sont admissibles) ou aux adjudants, en reconnaissance de services distingués et méritoires au combat. En 1920, les conditions ont été modifiées afin de préciser clairement que la Croix devait reconnaître les services courageux et distingués en présence de l’ennemi, et que les officiers de la marine et de l’aviation pouvaient l’obtenir pour des services courageux et distingués au sol. - Anciens Combattants Canada.[^2]   

[^2]: https://www.worldanvil.com/w/je-me-souviens/a/croix-militaire-item

Identifying the need to recognize junior commissioned officers and senior non-commissioned officers, the Military Cross was established on 28 December 1914 for commissioned officers of the substantive rank of Captain or below and for Warrant Officers. It was awarded for gallant and distinguished service in battle and recipients were entitled to the post-nominal letters MC.[^3]

**Volunteer Officers' Decoration, VD**   
The Volunteer Officers' Decoration, post-nominal letters VD, was instituted in 1892 as an award for long and meritorious service by officers of the United Kingdom's Volunteer Force. Award of the decoration was discontinued in the United Kingdom when it was superseded by the Territorial Decoration in 1908, but it continued to be awarded in some Crown Dependencies until 1930.

The Volunteer Officers' Decoration, post-nominal letters VD and colloquially known as the Volunteer Decoration, was instituted by Queen Victoria's Royal Warrant on 25 July 1892. The decoration could be awarded to efficient and thoroughly capable officers of proven capacity for long and meritorious service in the part-time Volunteer Force of the United Kingdom.[^VD]
