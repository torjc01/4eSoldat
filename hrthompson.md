Harry Ralph Thompson was born April 22,1929 to William and Matilda (nee Erskine) Thompson in Rosemount, Montreal.  He was the youngest of 5 children.  His oldest brother Jack was killed in WWII and his name in inscribed in the Book of Remembrance in Ottawa. His two other brothers both served, Ronald in the Air Force and Douglas in the Navy.  Having only a Grade 6 education did not leave much room for employment so he worked as a milkman before signing up for the Navy even altering his birth certificate to sign up earlier than what was allowed.  He trained at Cornwallis and enrolled in the diver program.  He served mostly on the HMCS Nootka as both Hard Hat Diver and Frogman.  He saw action in Korea during the Korean War.

He was married on October 31, 1952 to Phyllis Alexandra Young. He reached the designation of Chief Petty Officer by the end of his naval career being stationed mostly in Dartmouth. He sailed around the world and actually lost a day because he didn't sail back to Canada the way he had come, crossing the International Date Line only once.  It was always a joke that he was going to ask for his pay with interest.  He also served in the Arctic, Quebec and Nova Scotia.  He retired from the Navy before I was born in 1960.  His best friend William (Bill) Allen was instrumental in the construction of the Korean Wall of Remembrance in Mississauga.
